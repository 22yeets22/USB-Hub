## Project Overview

This project was my first experience with PCB design software. My goals were:

1. Learn PCB design and EasyEDA workflow
2. Build something useful: a small USB hub (used this [tutorial](https://jams.hackclub.com/tag/pcb))

## Files Included (all located in the `pcb/` directory)

* **Gerber files** (for PCB fabrication)
* **Pick and Place file** (for assembly)
* **BOM.csv** (Bill of Materials)
