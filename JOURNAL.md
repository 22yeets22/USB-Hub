## 10/12/2025 1 PM - Created the schematic  

Today I decided to learn how to use EasyEDA to create the schematic. I thought it would be really hard, but after following a short YouTube video to learn how to use it, I understood it pretty well. I was kinda confused about nets and capacitors, but I figured it out after a few more tutorials.
Of course, I had problems. Halfway through making the schematic, my computer randomly shut down and I didn't save, so I had to start over, which sucked.
Eventually I did manage to make a working schematic (i think):

## 10/12/2025 6 PM - Routed most of the PCB  

I spent the day routing most of the PCB for my USB Hub. This was a lot harder than the schematic, since the traces couldn't overlap, and I had to learn how to use vias and grounds. With traces that can't overlap and vias and grounds to figure out, I had to learn as I went. While working, I was also busy figuring out the controls, but I feel like I've gotten a lot better.
Unfortunately, I also learned that USB's have a great deal of timing involved, so I had to adjust the trace length to perfectly match each other, which was a lot of hard work.
I'm pretty happy with where I got today, and I'll probably polish it up later.
