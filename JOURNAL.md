## 10/12/2025 1 PM - Created the schematic  

Today I decided to learn how to use EasyEDA to create the schematic. I thought it would be really hard, but after following a short YouTube video to learn how to use it, I understood it pretty well. Honestly all you have to do is to create connections to things that need to be connected. I was kinda confused about nets and capacitors, and I went down a rabbit hole of tutorials (which luckily didn't go too far)...
I thought I was doing great, and I was almost done making the schematic. Then my computer randomly shut down and, of course, there was no auto save and I didn't save, so I had to start over, which sucked.
Eventually I did manage to make a working schematic (I think):

## 10/12/2025 6 PM - Routed most of the PCB  

I spent the day routing most of the PCB for my USB Hub. This was a lot harder than the schematic, since the traces couldn't overlap, and I had to learn how to use vias and grounds. With traces that can't overlap and vias and grounds to figure out, I had to learn as I went. While working, I was also busy figuring out the controls, but I feel like I've gotten a lot better.
Unfortunately, I also learned that USB's have a great deal of timing involved, so I had to adjust the trace length to perfectly match each other, which was a lot of hard work.
I'm pretty happy with where I got today, and I'll probably polish it up later.

## 10/12/2025 9 PM - Completely finished routing the PCB  

**I completely finished routing the PCB!**
I made some slight changes to the distances of the USB signals, and I also added the power LED on it. I also changed the traces near the top near the male USB to make it easier to solder, and changed up the labels + added a title.

## 10/13/2025 - Small routing adjustments  

I made a few super small adjustments to the PCB - you probably wouldn't notice.
1. I adjusted the trace length from the microcontroller to USB0 (the main usb), so that the signals would be synced up (I forgot about that last time).
2. Changed the placement of a few small parts.
3. A few more wiring simplifications.

New PCB

## 10/14/2025 - Added Ground Pours + Stitched Vias  

Today I was going to ship my project, but before I did, I shared it in the blueprint channel to see if anyone had suggestions. I was told to use ground pours and stitched vias. I had never worked with them before, so this was all new.
After a bit more research, I learned that a ground pour is a large area of copper that is all connected to ground.
I tweaked a lot of the settings, like the islands and the isolation from other traces. I also learned that spokes connect pads to ground to make soldering easier.
I realized that this would have made soldering much harder, and I was trying to figure out how I could possible remove some of the fill from a region. You wouldn't believe this, but it took me like 1 hour of banging my head on the table to figure out that I needed to make a new fill that was blank...
Anyways, here's my new PCB and 3D:
